## Motivation:

> [The research office] has recommended I get in touch with you in relation to setting up [a university approved tool] for my research data, something that's a requirement of ethics clearance for projects at [the university] now.Â I'm not sure if there is some generic training I can get on this or if you have further advice around it?

-- A researcher at one of the authors' institutions.


## Active Data Management on the Cloud

Researchers in [Australia](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php), [CERN](http://cernbox.web.cern.ch/), and around the world have access to local open source [owncloud](https://owncloud.org) research storage clouds. 

They are told to manage their active research data, and expected to get on with it. This workshop aims to bridge that gap, slightly.


## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is suitable for anyone needing to manage research data for internal teams or with external collaborators.


# Prerequisites

> ## Tools you need
>
> * A laptop able to connect to the internet.
> * The ability to access [cloudstor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php), or your local owncloud instance.
