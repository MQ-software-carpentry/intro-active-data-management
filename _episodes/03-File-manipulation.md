* Working with active research data

There are lots of simple ways you can manage your active data so that it is easy to find and safely stored.

You can set up an automatic way to move your data to the cloud so that your data is safe and secure. This is called 'syncing'. You can also ensure that you are sharing your data securely by knowing what tools are best for this operation (hint: might not be email!).

A little bit of effort now will pay off tenfold in the future.

# CloudStor

    1. Go to the AARNet website: https://www.aarnet.edu.au/
    2. Click on 'Log In and Tools' in the top righthand corner of the page.
    3. Select 'CloudStor'.
    4. Choose your organisation and click on 'Login at AARNet'.
    5. Sign-in with your credentials - user name and password - and click 'Login'.  

You are now in CloudStor, which is a cloud storage environment.

## Syncing data

Using the ownCloud Sync Client you can keep your computer and your CloudStor folders up to date automatically.

## Sync Password

If you wish to use the optional sync clients from ownCloud, you will be required to set a separate ownCloud sync password. This password can be set from the "Settings" page.

Note: This password is only for use with the sync clients and is not used to login to CloudStor.

## Download the Desktop Sync Client

You can download the Cloudstor sync client for Windows, OSX, IOS, Linux and Android [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/client-download/).

Follow the instructions to install the client.

## Configuring the ownCloud Desktop Sync Client

  1. Install and open the ownCloud Desktop Sync Client. You will be prompted for the server address, enter https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus and click "Next"
  2. Enter your institutional email address as your username and the sync password you created (not the password for your institutional login) and then click "Next".
  3. Ensure "Sync Everything" is selected and then click "Connect..." and CloudStor will start synchronising your data.
  4. Click on Cloudstor icon to expand the folders you have access to from the web client.
  5. To access a group folder, click on Shared folder to expand.
  6. Click on the folder you need to access.

NOTE: If saving or adding documents it can take a few seconds to 30 sec to update the web client. If large volumes of data, it can take a while.

## Cloudstor sync client on your smartphone

You can find the CloudStor app in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store by searching "CloudStor" on your device.

## FileSender

FileSender is a way to send many and large files to your colleagues that can be encrypted so it is a secure transfer.

# File manipulation

Once you have your sync, share and store processes in place, take a look at your file organisation. How can you do this better?

Let's now look at the benefits and best practices of gathering your data in one place, using planned folder  structures(also known as 'directories') and naming conventions for your files.

> 2. Take a look at the [sample file directory on cloudstor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/DvGaUjzWoOe7lTN)
> 3. Using the guide, rename the folders using best practice naming conventions.
