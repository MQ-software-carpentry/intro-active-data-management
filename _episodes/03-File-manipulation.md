## File manipulation:

* Organisation:
    * gathering data in one place,
    * creating file directories and naming conventions
    * knowing best practice for data management - manage, describe and store data files

> ## Challenge - direct activity
Using this guide https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/media/440281/formattingorganising.pdf, take a look at the file directory here: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/DvGaUjzWoOe7lTN and organise the files using best practice naming conventions.

* Working with active data:
    * sync/move data to the cloud, download
    * syncing data
    * use library data safely and securely (sharing, storing)
    * using cloud storage proficiently including storing, sharing, sending and syncing

    > ## Challenge - Think, pair, share
    Where is your data now? How do you store, share, sync, protect, back up etc your files? Could this be done differently?

### CloudStor
    1. Go to the AARNet website: https://www.aarnet.edu.au/
    2. Click on 'Log In and Tools' in the top righthand corner of the page.
    3. Select 'CloudStor'.
    4. Choose your organisation and click on 'Login at AARNet'.
    5. Sign-in with your credentials - user name and password - and click 'Login'.  

You are now in CloudStor, which is a cloud storage environment.

#### Syncing data
Using the ownCloud Sync Client you can keep your computer and your CloudStor folders up to date automatically.

##### Sync Password

If you wish to use the optional sync clients from ownCloud, you will be required to set a separate ownCloud sync password. This password can be set from the "Settings" page.

Note: This password is only for use with the sync clients and is not used to login to CloudStor.

##### Download the Desktop Sync Client

You can download the Cloudstor sync client for Windows, OSX, IOS, Linux and Android here:

	https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/client-download/

Follow the instructions to install the client.

##### Configuring the ownCloud Desktop Sync Client

Install and open the ownCloud Desktop Sync Client. You will be prompted for the server address, enter https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus and click "Next"

Enter your institutional email address as your username and the sync password you created (not the password for your institutional login) and then click "Next"

Ensure "Sync Everything" is selected and then click "Connect..." and CloudStor will start synchronising your data.

Click on Cloudstor icon to expand the folders you have access to from the web client.

To access a group folder, click on Shared folder to expand.

Click on the required folder you require access to.

If saving or adding documents it can take a few seconds to 30 sec to update the web client. If large volumes of data, it can take a while.
