>    1. You need to figure out the third question. Options include: Favourite colour, airspeed of an unladen swallow, most recent research paper they found interesting?

> Are you familiar with these terms in this context? What are the ones that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word or term means in this context that might help others understand it better. How could you define a term (or two!) above to make it easier to understand? Write your definitions down in the etherpad - we can add to this list as we go and keep it as a resource for the future.
