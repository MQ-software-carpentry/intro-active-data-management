# Acknowledgement of country

# Code of Conduct

# Introductions

* Introduce instructors and helpers
* Introduce workshop over two days - where we are going and how we will get there

# Protocol for Zoom - Sticky Notes and reactions

* Pop out the chat and reactions windows.
* Use chat to ask questions of each other **at any time**. This is one of the more awesome benefits of an online workshop. Side conversations are entirely encouraged.
    * Chat to everyone if you have a question or response to everyone, or to the instructors.
    * Chat to individuals if you want to hold a private conversation. 
    * If you chat to someone privately, their chat usually changes to private in response. Don't forget to check who you're chatting to.

Everyone: say hi in chat! Say hi to someone else, privately!

We will use reactions to see how folk are going. Use the green check to say "I'm done with the challenge! Everything works!" Use the red x to say "could someone contact me to help me?" It is awesome to help each other out, and to ask for help. This is one of the best ways to learn. Use the raise hand icon to ask for our attention. (Remind us in chat if we don't see your hand after a while.)

Everyone: Put up a big happy green check!

# Plan for the workshop

## Part 1

* Research Data Management
* File Manipulation
* Backups

## Part 2

* Collaboration
* FAIR and the paper of the future!


# Shared editable document

> ## Ice-breaker (10 minutes)
>
> 1. Get to know your fellow participants (in breakout rooms).
>    1. "What ... is your name?"
>    1. "What ... is your quest?" (Or, for those who are not Monty Python fans -- perhaps instead you can ask "What drives you? Or, what is your current major life goal?")
>    1. The third question is up to you. If you are stuck, options could include: "What is your favourite colour?", "What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow?" or "What is most recent research paper they found interesting?"
> 1. Write a two sentence summary of one of your fellow participants that you met during the icebreaker in the shared document.

# Jargon busting

This exercise is an opportunity to begin to ask questions and to get a firmer grasp on the concepts around research data management.

> ## Challenge - Jargonâ€½ (10 minutes)
>
> In pairs, look at the list of terms on the shared document.
>
> * research data
> * research data management
> * upload/download
> * data movement
> * cloud storage
> * cloud computing
> * sync
> * collaborative document
> * collaborative editing
> * etherpad
> * active data
> * sensitive data
> * repository
> * GitHub
> * computational notebooks/Jupyter Notebooks
>
> Are you familiar with these terms in this context? What are the ones that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word or term means in this context that might help others understand it better. How could you define a term (or two!) above to make it easier to understand? Write your definitions down in the etherpad - we can add to this list as we go and keep it as a resource for the future.
