# Objectives

* {BRIAN: Is this objectives of the whole workshop or just this episode?}

# Shared editable document

> ## Ice-breaker
>
> 1. Get to know your fellow participants (either in one group or breakout rooms).
>    1. "What is your name?"
>    1. "What is your quest?" {BRIAN: I don't understand this question}
>    1. The third question is up to you. If you are stuck, ptions could include: "What is your favourite colour and why?", "What is the airspeed of an unladen swallow?" or "What is most recent research paper they found interesting?"
> 1. Write a two sentence summary of one of your fellow participants that you met during the icebreaker in the etherpad.

# Jargon busting

This exercise is an opportunity to begin to ask questions and to get a firmer grasp on the concepts around research data management.

> ## Challenge
> 
> In pairs, look at the list of terms here: [link to etherpad]
>
>* upload/download
>* data movement
>* cloud storage
>* cloud computing
>* sync
>* collaborative editing
>* etherpad
>* active data
>* sensitive data
>* repository
>* FTP

> Are you familiar with these terms in this context? What are the ones that trip you up? Think of a way to remember what that word or term means in this context that might help others understand it better. How could you define a term (or two!) above to make it easier to understand? Write your definitions down in the etherpad - we can add to this list as we go and keep it as a resource for the future.
