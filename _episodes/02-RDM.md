# Outline

* What is 'research data'?
* What do we mean by 'Research Data Management'?
* Why do we care?

# Research Data

What examples can you think of?

# Research Data Management (aka RDM)

## What could possibly go wrong? Why RDM?

Start with a chat about the kinds of things that happen when researchers wing it.

Be your own best data manager - the one most likely to benefit (and suffer) is you!

# Data Management Policies and Plans

## Best laid plans

Research data is important! Please take care of it.

Universities around the world have developed a range of policies and procedures outlining their expectations around research data management. Let's have a look at some university's RDM statements.

 Practice makes perfect. :smile:

 * Expectations of a data management plan
    * capacity to answer HDR and ECR questions and turn needs into specific actions
    * clear understanding of research data management landscape

> ## Challenge
>Find your university's RDM policy. Read it for understanding. What questions do you have?
>
> OR Read a couple of RDM policies and seek differences. Discuss.

OK. Let's say that you have suddenly become responsible for an entire team's research data. If anything happens, it's on you. What can you do?

* How to think about research data
   * communicate with influence the value of active data management best practice
   * understanding the requirement for data management

> ## Challenge
>Write down a convincing argument for a team to switch to cloud for collaboration.
