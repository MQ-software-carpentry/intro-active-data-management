# Outline

* What is 'research data'?
* What do we mean by 'Research Data Management'?
* Why do we care?

# Research Data

What examples can you think of?

# Research Data Management (aka RDM)

## What could possibly go wrong? Why RDM?

Start with a chat about the kinds of things that happen when researchers wing it.

Be your own best data manager - the one most likely to benefit (and suffer) is you!

Universities around the world have developed a range of policies and procedures outlining their expectations around research data management. Let's have a look at some university's RDM statements.

 Practice makes perfect. :smile:

 * Expectations of a data management plan
    * capacity to answer HDR and ECR questions and turn needs into specific actions
    * clear understanding of research data management landscape

> ## Challenge - RDM Policy
>
> Read a couple of RDM policies and seek differences. Discuss.
> [UOW](https://documents.uow.edu.au/about/policy/UOW116802.html) versus CSU [https://policy.csu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00328]
> 1. What backup requirements do each of these have?
> 1. What data publishing requirements do they have?
> Write your answers in the etherpad as a team.

OK. Let's say that you have suddenly become responsible for an entire team's research data. If anything happens, it's on you. What can you do?

* How to think about research data
   * communicate with influence the value of active data management best practice
   * understanding the requirement for data management

> ## Challenge - Arguments for Collaboration
>
> In the shared document, as a group, make a paragraph convincing argument for a team to switch to cloud for collaboration.
