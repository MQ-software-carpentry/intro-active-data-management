title: "Research Data Management"
teaching: 20
exercises: 80
questions:
- "What is Research Data Management?"
- "Why should a researcher care about data management?"
objectives:
- "Discuss research data"
- "Learn about the research data lifecycle"
- "Discover anti-sharing patterns"
keypoints:
- "Research Data Management is the planning and application of a plan to manage the full data lifecycle, from creation to collection and analysis and then to publication and archiving."
- "A good data management plan will result in more consistent data, less time spent cleaning data, and reusable data that can generate better impact."

* What is 'research data'?
* What do we mean by 'Research Data Management'?
* Why do we care?

# Research Data

What examples can you think of?

# Research Data Management (aka RDM)

## What could possibly go wrong? Why RDM?

Start with a chat about the kinds of things that happen when researchers wing it.

Be your own best data manager - the one most likely to benefit (and suffer) is you!

> ## Challenge - A video on data sharing (30 minutes)
>
> 1. In breakout rooms, watch this video in small groups: [Data Sharing and Management Snafu in 3 Short Acts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4)
> 1. Discuss: Have you run into any of these scenarios? What happened? How should this have gone? Write your room's conclusions in the etherpad.
> 1. Share: When we get back together, each room should share some of its worst horror stories (with the names changed to protect the innocent).

# Data Management Policies and Plans

## Best laid plans

Research data is important! Please take care of it.

> {FIXME Sara, this isn't a diagnostic question. Can we make it instead be a question which can identify if anyone doesn't understand RDM? https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning/index.html#formative-assessments-come-in-many-forms}

Universities around the world have developed a range of policies and procedures outlining their expectations around research data management. Let's have a look at some university's RDM statements.

Practice makes perfect. :smile:

 * Expectations of a data management plan
    * capacity to answer HDR and ECR questions and turn needs into specific actions
    * clear understanding of research data management landscape

> ## Challenge - RDM Policy (30 minutes)
>
> Read a two of RDM policies and seek differences. Discuss in breakout rooms.
> [UOW](https://documents.uow.edu.au/about/policy/UOW116802.html) versus [CSU](https://policy.csu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00328)
> {FIXME: Sara, why these two universities? Can we think about perhaps pointinug at guidelines} Maybe https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@gov/documents/doc/uow228264.pdf versus https://research.csu.edu.au/research-support/data-methods-and-tools/data-management ? The two guidelines do change meaningfully between publishing...

> 1. What backup requirements do each of these have?
> 1. What data publishing requirements do they have?
> 1. How do you think researchers in these institutions deal with these policies?

> Write your answers in the shared document as a team.

OK. Let's say that you have suddenly become responsible for an entire team's research data. If anything happens, it's on you. What can you do?

* How to think about research data
   * communicate with influence the value of active data management best practice
   * understanding the requirement for data management

> ## Challenge - Arguments for Collaboration (15 minutes)
>
> In the shared document, in breakout rooms, make a single paragraph argument for a team to switch to cloud for collaboration. 
>
> As everyone: discuss which paragraphs are most persuasive?
