# Paper of the future

    * Jupyter notebooks skills (where to find and store, open, use basic code, save and share)
    * working knowledge of Cloudstor and associated services

> ## Challenge - Read article
>
> Read ['The Scientific Paper is Obsolete'](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) and discuss in pairs/small groups. Write down the main points in the shared document.

# Jupyter Notebooks

[Some words about Jupyter Notebooks here]

[10 Simple Rules](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007007)

There are many different ways you can access Jupyter Notebooks via the web:

* [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
* [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com)
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
* [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/doc/jupyter-notebook.html)
* [Datalore](https://datalore.io/)

You can also install Anaconda and use notebooks without being online.

If you have an AAF log in you can access CloudStor and use SWAN for Jupyter Notebooks.

# SWAN

The Service for Web-based Analysis (SWAN) is a service for running data analysis in CloudStor. Using only a web browser, users can perform interactive data analysis in Jupyter Notebooks via SWAN and AARNetâ€™s shared cloud computing services, meaning you can run your analysis in the same location as your data.

> ## Challenge - Create a Jupyter Notebook

> * Log in to CloudStor.
>
> 1. Go to the AARNet website: https://www.aarnet.edu.au/
> 2. Click on 'Log In and Tools' in the top righthand corner of the page.
> 3. Select 'CloudStor'.
> 4. Choose your organisation and click on 'Login at AARNet'.
> 5. Sign-in with your credentials - user name and password - and click 'Login'.  
>
> * Create a Jupyter Notebook of your own.
>
> 1. At the top of the page there is a black banner that shows several icons. Click on the swan icon once.
> 2. From the 'Welcome to SWAN' (service for web-based analysis), click on 'Go to my Notebooks'.
> 3. You will notice here that you can see the spinning Jupyter icon come up on the screen. This means that a notebook is being created. This can take a minute or so.
> 4. When the next screen comes up you will see the launcher. Click on the Python tile.
> 5. Select 'File' at the top left hand side of the screen and select 'Save As'. Name your notebook 'Intro to Jupyter Notebooks'.

# Markdown

[Some words about markdown here]

> ## Challenge: Add narrative markdown
>Remember that [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is how you can make rich (or formatted) text in a plain text editor. Try using different headings, italics, bold and dot points.
