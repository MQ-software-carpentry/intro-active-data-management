# Getting and sending (sensitive) data

## Why not email?

* Not encrypted
* Cannot control access
* Cannot restrict when access ends
* Limited file size

## Filesender as one mechanism for exchanging data.

> ## Challenge - As a breakout room, securely send files around (10 minutes)
>
> Share a dataset from a group drive in Cloudstor via Cloudstor token (link), inviting someone to the document and via FileSender

# Collaboration and Citations

As academics we will collaborate on at least two of the following things:

* Papers
* Analysis
* Citations

# Live Collaboration

> ## Challenge: Investigate and Report. (45 minutes)
>
> In your breakout groups, investigate one of the following paper+citation collaboration options. Make sure to see if you can get a group making edits to the same document and adding citations to the same bibliography.
>
> Stuff to investigate with the resources below:
> 1. Make a group on whatever citation system you're using. A group is defined as some sort of shared space where different members of your breakout room can add citations. (Bonus points for editing.)
> 2. Everyone add 1 citation from a paper they have open. Otherwise search for papers about FAIR. Use the tool's automatic metadata harvesting if possible.
> 3. Everyone open up a shared document in whatever system you're trying. A shared document is one where everyone can contribute changes and edits without needing to email the document around.
> 4. Try to add your citation to that shared document, along with a 1 sentence summary of the document (or a copy-paste from its abstract)
> 5. Try to generate a PDF.
> 6. Summarise your outcomes in the hackmd shared document.
